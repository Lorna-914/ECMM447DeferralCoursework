Pornography main media category: See “Crackdown on Pornography: A No-Win Battle,” U.S. News and World Report, June 4, 1984. The Association of Fashion and Image Consultants tripled its membership between 1984 and 1989 alone (Annetta Miller and Dody Tsiantar, Newsweek, May 22, 1989). During the five or six years prior to 1986, consumer spending rose from $300 billion to $600 billion.

Recent research shows: See Dr. Thomas Cash, Diane Cash, and Jonathan Butters, “MirrorMirror on the Wall: Contrast Effects and Self-Evaluation of Physical Attractiveness,” Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, September 1983, vol. 9, no. 3. Dr. Cash’s research shows very little connection between “how attractive women are” and “how attractive they feel themselves to be.” All the women he treated were, in his terms, “extremely attractive,” but his patients compare themselves only to models, not to other women.

Myth: See also Roland Barthes’s definition: “It [myth] transforms history into nature….
Myth has the task of giving an historical intention a natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal.” Roland Barthes, “Myth Today,” Mythologies (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972), p. 129.
Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski’s definition of “a myth of origin” is relevant to the beauty myth: A myth of origin, writes Ann Oakley, “tends to be worked hardest in times of social strain, when the state of affairs portrayed in the myth are called into question.” Ann Oakley, Housewife: High Value/Low Cost (London: Penguin Books, 1987), p. 163.
Platonic: See Plato’s discussion of Beauty in Symposium. For varying standards of beauty, see Ted Polhemus, BodyStyles (Luton, England: Lennard Publishing, 1988).
ual selection; Darwin…was unconvinced: See Cynthia Eagle Russett, “Hairy Men and Beautiful Women,” ual Science: The Victorian Construction of Womanhood (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 78–103.
On page 84 Russett quotes Darwin: “Man is more powerful in body and mind than woman, and in the savage state he keeps her in a much more abject state of bondage, than does the male of any other animal; therefore it is not surprising that he should have gained the power of selection…. As women have long been selected for beauty, it is not surprising that some of their successive variations should have been transmitted exclusively to the same sex; consequently that they should have transmitted beauty in a somewhat higher degree to their female than to their male offspring, and thus have become more beautiful, according to general opinion, than men.” Darwin himself noticed the evolutionary inconsistency of this idea that, as Russett puts it, “a funny thing happened on the way up the ladder: among humans, the female no longer chose but was chosen.” This theory “implied an awkward break in evolutionary continuity,” she observes: “In Darwin’s own terms it marked a rather startling reversal in the trend of evolution.” See also Natalie Angier, “Hard-to-Please Females May Be Neglected Evolutionary Force,” The New York Times, May 8, 1990, and Natalie Angier, “Mating for Life? It’s Not for the Birds or the Bees,” The New York Times, August 21, 1990.

Wodaabe tribe: Leslie Woodhead, “Desert Dandies,” The Guardian, July 1988.
In the West African Fulani tribe young women choose their husbands on the basis of their beauty: “The contestants…take part in the yaake, a line-up in which they sing and dance, stand on tip-toe and make faces, rolling and crossing their eyes and grimacing to show off their teeth to the judges. They keep this up for hours, aided by the consumption of stimulating drugs beforehand. Throughout all this, old ladies in the crowd hurl criticisms at those who do not live up to the Fulani idea of beauty.” [Polhemus, op. cit., p. 21] See also Carol Beckwith and Marion van Offelen, Nomads of Niger (London: William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd., 1984), cited in Carol Beckwith, “Niger’s Wodaabe: People of the Taboo,” National Geographic, vol. 164, no. 4, October 1983, pp. 483–509.
Paleolithic excavations suggest that it has been human males rather than females to whom adornment was assigned in prehistoric societies; in modern tribal communities men generally adorn at least as much as women, and often hold “a virtual monopoly” over adornment. The Sudanese Nuba, the Australian Waligigi, and the Mount Hagen men of New Guinea also spend hours painting themselves and perfecting their hairstyles to attract the women, whose toilette takes only minutes. See Polhemus, op. cit, pp. 54–55.

ual harassment: In a survey of nine thousand Redbook readers, 88 percent reported sexual harassment in the workplace. Hearn et al., op. cit., p. 80.
In the United Kingdom, where there is no specific law against it, 86 percent of managers and 66 percent of employees “had seen” sexual harassment, according to an Alfred Marks Bureau survey; a British Civil Service study found that 70 percent of women employees had been subjected to it. See British Society of Civil and Public Servants, ual Harassment: A Trade Union Issue, pamphlet, p. 14.

See also p. 17: “How many thousands of employers hire women for their ‘aesthetic’ appeal?” Since 1981, the number of sexual-harassment complaints filed has nearly doubled, 94 percent of them brought by women, most of them serious charges, i.e., sexual assault, physical contact, or threats of job loss. Only 31 percent of the decisions favored the plaintiff.

Use their appearance: “I use my personal appearance to my advantage in getting things accomplished on the job” is a statement that more men agree with than women. According to a recent study by psychologist Andrew DuBrin of the Rochester Institute of Technology, of 300 men and women, 22 percent of men use their appearance to get ahead, as opposed to 14 percent of women; 22 percent of men versus 15 percent of women admit using manipulation, and 40 percent of men versus 29 percent of women use charm.
Cited in Marjory Roberts, “place Wiles: Who Uses Beauty and Charm?,” Psychology Today, May 1989.
According to Barbara A. Gutek: “My surveys found relatively little evidence that women routinely or even occasionally use their sexuality to try to gain some organizational goal. There is even less support for the position that women have succeeded or advanced at work by using their sexuality…. In comparison to women, men may not only use sex more often at work, they may be more successful at it!” [Hearn et al., op.

“What part did women’s magazines play in all this [the feminist agenda]?” Ferguson asked. “Most editors busily grappling with the problems of how to target audiences more tightly, or prevent circulation decline, were aware that some changes were taking place outside their offices, but often lacked any systematic information about their nature or extent…. Some editors related women going out to work to diminished ‘time’ and ‘need’ for women’s magazines: “‘Then there is the business of women going out to work. Once you go out to work you have less time; your needs are different, and they might have been answered by either television, newspapers, or by the television programme paper.’ (Women’s weekly editor)” Helen Gurley Brown, Cosmopolitan’s editor, increased its circulation from 700,000 in 1965 to 2.89 million copies a month in 1981. According to Brown, “Cosmopolitan is every girl’s sophisticated older sister…. Cosmopolitan says you can get anything if you really try, if you don’t just sit on your backside with your nose pressed to the glass…. We carry our profile, one piece on health, one on sex, two on emotions…one on man/woman relationships, one on careers, one short story and one part of a major work of fiction, as well as our regular columns.” Quoted in Ferguson, p. 37.

Also, concerning competition with pornography, see Tony Garnett, director of Handgun, Weintraub Enterprises, quoted in “Rape: That’s Entertainment?,” Jane Mills, producer, Omnibus, BBC1, September 15, 1989. According to Garnett, “One of the reasons a film like this is probably financed is because there is a rape scene at the center of it. There was…a considerable pressure from the various distributors who controlled it. Most of the people who dealt with it were very disappointed in the film, particularly in the rape because it was not sexually exciting and I was asked if we had any off-cuts that we could re-cut in to make it more sexually exciting because that sells tickets.” 30 percent U.S. made: “Stars and Stripes Everywhere,” The Observer, October 8, 1989.

Some European foreign ministers believe that “by the end of the next decade the US-dominated media empires will have a stranglehold on global broadcasting.” [John Palmer, “European Ministers Divided Over US ‘Media Imperialism,’” The Guardian, Oct. 3, 1989.] In “Review and Appraisal: Communication and Media,” a paper presented to the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women, Nairobi, 1985 (A/CONF. 116/5), a worldwide survey found that in the media, there is little representation of women’s changing roles. In Mexico, women are “the soul of the home” or the “sex object.” In Turkey, the typical woman in the media is “mother, wife, sex symbol”; the Ivory Coast emphasizes her “charm, beauty, frivolity, fragility.” Cited in Taylor et al., op. cit., p. 78.

Harlow and Harlow’s experiments in the 1950’s proved beyond doubt that if a baby monkey is reared in isolation, unable either to experiment with coevals or to observe its elders copulating (which young primates do, with great curiosity and often at hamperingly close quarters, whenever they can), then, when it grows up, it hasn’t got the faintest idea how to go about it, and if it is a male, it dies without issue.” Jack Sullivan: Quoted in Jane Caputi, The Age of Crime (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1987), p. 63.

Middle-class: Brumberg, Fasting Girls, p. 9. Ninety to 95 percent of anorexics are young, white, female, and disproportionately middle- and upper-class. The “contagion” is confined to the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and areas experiencing “rapid Westernization” [Ibid., pp. 12–13]. Recent studies show that the higher the man’s income, the lower his wife’s weight [Seid, op. cit., p. 16].

An indifferent eye: The Intercollegiate Eating Disorders Conference, mentioned by Brumberg [op. cit.], did draw many colleges’ representatives. But according to women’s centers in several Ivy League universities, eating diseases are not dealt with beyond self-help groups, and certainly not at an administrative level. The entire term’s budget for the Yale University Women’s Center is $600, up from $400 in 1984. “Diet-conscious female students report that fasting, weight control and binge eating are a normal pan of life on American college campuses.” [Brumberg, op. cit., p. 264, citing K. A. Halmi, J. R. Falk, and E. Schwartz, “Binge-Eating and Vomiting: A Survey of a College Population,” Psychological Medicine 11 (1981), pp. 697–706.] Disgust: Quoted in Robin Tolmach Lakoff and Raquel L.

See Standard and Poor’s Industry Surveys (New York: Standard and Poor’s Corp., 1988) and Martin Walker, “Beauty World Goes Peanuts,” The Guardian (London), September 20, 1989. But since over 80 percent of eyelifts, facelifts, and nose operations are on female patients, as are virtually all breast surgery and liposuction operations, the true female-male ratio must be higher than 87 percent—meaning that cosmetic surgery is only properly understood as a processing of femaleness. See, for figures, Joanna Gibbon, “A Nose by Any Other Shape,” The Independent (London), January 19, 1989.

Cancer detection more difficult: In a study involving twenty breast-cancer patients with implants, researchers found that none of the tumors had been detected early with X rays, and the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes of thirteen by the time the disease was detected: Michele Goodwin, “Silicone Breast Implants,” The New Haven Advocate, March 13, 1989. The Public Citizen Health Research Group made the charge to implant manufacturers Dow Corning Corp., citing the manufacturers’ own research that 23 percent of female laboratory rats implanted with silicone developed cancer. The Group also points out that implants have been followed only for ten or twelve years, not long enough for the cancers to develop. The literature of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery denies any risk.

Manufacturing mental illness: Eating disorders are mutating into self-mutilation, creating a new wave of young women who cut themselves up. “A growing number of ‘self-lacerating’ young women…One bulimic binged and vomited until she felt so out of control that she ‘grabbed a knife and stuck it into [her] stomach.’” [Maggy Ross, “Shocking Habit,” Company, September 1988]. Three “attractive young women” who feel “physically repulsive” and “evil inside” regularly cut a pattern of up to sixty diagonal slashes on their forearms, feeling numb and detached. “I couldn’t stand being so judged,” said one [Michele Hanson, “An End to the Hurting,” Elle, October 1988].

Dr. Stuart Yuspa of the National Cancer Institute refers to Retin-A/tretonoin prescriptions as “a human experiment.” [Jane E. Brody, “Personal Health,” The New York Times, June 16, 1988.] Nuremberg: The Code of Ethics of Human Experimentation was laid down on August 19, 1947, at the Nuremberg Military Tribunal. [See David A. Frankele, “Human Experimentation: Codes of Ethics,” in Amnon Karmi, ed., Medical Experimentation (Ramat Gan, Israel: Turtledove Publishing, 1978).] The Berlin Medical School adapted a formulation (by Thomas Percival, 1803), a version of which was later adapted by the American Medical Association, that forbids “risk of any man’s life…by vain experimentation, or doubtful means” and condemns debasing oneself by employing one’s art “for…immoral purposes.” In September 1948, the General Assembly of the World Medical Association adopted the Declaration of Geneva: “A doctor shall not in any circumstances do, authorize to be done or condone anything that would weaken the physical or mental resistance of a human being, except for the prevention and treatment of disease.” The Nuremberg Code was “meant to reinstate ‘existing general principles of human experimentation accepted by all civilized nations.’” German courts after Nuremburg “have considered every medical operation or other treatment invading the human body technically to be assault and battery, which in general needs to be justified by the patient’s informed consent.” [A. Karmi, “Legal Problems,” in Medical Experimentation.] Without “free choice,” the procedure is criminal: “It is generally agreed that scientific experiments cannot be undertaken without the free consent of the person subjected to them after having been duly informed.” [Gerfried F. Scher, quoted in Karmi, op. cit., p.
100.] Moreover, “the decision to participate in a scientific clinical trial must be perfectly free and uninfluenced by any sort of dependency.” [Ibid., p. 101] Cosmetic surgery violates current codes of medical ethics as well: As the chief U.S.
medical adviser at the war trials adapted the code: “The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have the legal capacity to give consent, should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests with the experimenter (minors cannot be considered to consent)…. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved in the experiment.” Regarding fraud, deceit, etc.: The State Court of Michigan ruled that the “inherently coercive atmosphere” surrounding one medical experiment made “truly informed consent impossible.” Regarding minors’ maturity to consent: Cosmetic surgeons have targeted teenage girls as a new market; they operate on them with parental consent in spite of their status as minors.
Regarding nontherapeutic experiments: “The risks to be run must be in reasonable proportion to the possible benefits. If the experiment entails actual risk to the subject’s life, his consent is invalid even if he has been informed of this…. The same holds true where there is an actual risk of heavy and lasting damage to the patient’s health.” [Italics added] For the patient’s own benefit, the experimental nature of new treatments must be disclosed: “His general consent to the treatment without knowing its experimental character is not sufficient.” The law governing medical practice in the United States depends on the concepts of Standards of Care to distinguish between those medical and surgical procedures generally accepted by the medical professions and those that are not. According to Martin L. Norton: “We should…regard anything done to a patient, which is not for his direct therapeutic benefit or contributory to the diagnosis of his disease, as constituting an experiment.” [Ibid., pp. 107–109] 1 in 30,000 possibility of death: Joanna Gibbon, Independent Guide to Cosmetic Surgery (The Independent, 1989), pamphlet, p. 7.
According to the Guide, silicone implants for breast augmentation “leach to other parts of the body, and the long-term effects are unknown,” and there is a 10 to 40 percent chance that the scar tissue will harden into “a cricket ball,” necessitating “a further operation to split the scar capsule.” [Ibid., p. 8.] McKnight, op. cit., asserts that the chances are 70 percent that the implants will harden. Dr. Peter Davis at St. Thomas Hospital in England asserts that “Mortality…is reported to be up by 10 percent in America.” [McKnight, op. cit, pp. 114, 120.] “If [U.S.] doctors were to admit to a 10 percent failure rate, which is normal in our experience out of every thousand facelifts, they’d lose their practice. Take the breast prosthesis we’ve been inserting for years here—it has a 70 percent complication rate. Yet there are people in America quoting 1 percent. One of us has to be telling the truth.” Liposuction deaths: Wenda B. O’Reilly, The Beautiful Body Book: A Guide to Effortless Weight Loss. (New York: Bantam, 1989).
Liposuction…count of eleven: Robin Marantz Henig, “The High Cost of Thinness,” The New York Times Magazine, February 28, 1988.
As many as 90 percent: See McKnight, op. cit When I asked the spokeswoman for the ASPRS what the likelihood of “capular contraction,” in her words, might be, she replied, “It’s impossible to say. Some surgeons have ten percent and some have ninety percent.” “Aren’t there any studies with complication rates?” “No. Every woman’s different. It’s not fair to a woman to tell her she can’t have the operation because there might be these numbers.” Addicts: See Maria Kay, “Plastic Makes Perfect,” She, July 1988: “It’s quite painful afterwards, because your jaw feels dislocated…you have to go on a liquid diet…food particles cause infection if they catch in the stitches, but you can’t chew anyway. You can’t smile, your face aches. My face swelled up like a hamster’s and I had terrible yellow bruising and trauma.” Chemical peeling “makes you go brown and crispy, then a scab forms and drops off.” See also “Scalpel Slaves Just Can’t Quit!,” Newsweek, January 11, 1988.

I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury or wrongdoing….
I will keep pure and holy both in my life and my art. In whatsoever house I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrongdoing and harm….
now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain forever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I transgress it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me.
